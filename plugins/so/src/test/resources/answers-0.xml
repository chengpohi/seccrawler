First, doing it that way means I have to construct the Foos first, then feed their values to the mock reader which does nothing to &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; the amount of code I'm writing. Second, if the values pass through the reader, the Foos won't be the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; Foos (reference equality). They might be &lt;em&gt;equal&lt;/em&gt;, but even that's assuming too much of the Foo class that I don't dare touch at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="266" OwnerDisplayName="Rytmis" LastActivityDate="2008-08-27T17:00:00.517" CommentCount="0" />
